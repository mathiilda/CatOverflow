# CatOverflow
A Stackoverflow inspired website but instead of code it's cats! This website was made as the final project in the ramverk1-course.

### How to install
1. Run <code>git clone https://github.com/mathiilda/CatOverflow</code>.

2. Run <code>sqlite3 data/db.sqlite < sql/cat_sqlite.sql</code> in the root of the <code>CatOverflow</code>-folder.
  
3. Last but not least, run <code>make install test</code>.
  
Then you are ready the use the application! :-)
